# Learn OpenGL
These are some programs I wrote while working through [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/).

So far I've worked up through the chapter "Simple Lighting".

Contents
* Simple Rect - Shows a square made of 2 white rectangles.
* Chromatic Rect - Shows the Simple Rect square with a shader that interpolates the colors assigned to the vertices.
* Texture Rect - Shows the Simple Rect with some textures applied.
* Transform Rect - Shows the Texture Rect, but translated and rotating.
* Rotating Cube - Shows a bunch of rotating cubes whose faces are the Texture Rect.
* Flying Camera - Fly around the Rotating Cubes. Use WASD to change direction and Space to move forward.
* Phong Cube - Shows the textured cube lit with the Phong lighting model. Also has the flying camera.
